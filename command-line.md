The command line acts as a translator. It takes what we type and translates it into a set of commands the computer can understand.And then the computer goes off and does what we have asked it to do (in theory anyway).
Pwd - show me where I am (its like marking your current location on a map).
mkdir - make a directory this allows you to create a folder that holds other folders and files.
ls - list directory this means you are asking the computer to show you all the folders and files that are in a particular directory or place.
find -this tells the computer to find the file you are looking for.
mv - this moves a file from one place to another place but it can also rename a file
cp - copy a file or directory to another place. This is different from the mv (move) command  because the move command will copy the file into wherever you want it to go and then destroy the original whereas the copy command doesnt delete the original.
rmdir - remove a directory that has no files or other directories in it- makes you wonder why its there in the first place.
cd - take me to wherever I tell you.
pushd - I want to go to a new place but don't forget where I came from.
popd - take me back to where I came from.
